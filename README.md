2. Logging in with "S" number and password;
3. Adding schedule manually, while logged in as a student;
4. Viewing classrooms on the map, repesented as red dots, according to personal schedule;
5. [^1] Tracing path to a selected classroom from staircases and elevators.
6. [^1] Adding points of interest available to everyone, who visits the website (onigiri stand on the first floor, cafeteria, coffee stand in Building A, toilets, companies' whereabouts during job fairs etc.);
7. [^1] Adding schedule automatically if group number is provided;
